\section{Service API}
\label{ch:serviceapi}

For registering a service in Luci, a set of three parameters have to be implemented into the service and forwarded to Luci using the built-in service \texttt{RemoteRegister} (Appendix \ref{ch:builtinservices:RemoteRegister}).

The three required fields are
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{serviceName}: The service name as a string
  \item \texttt{description}: The service description as a string
  \item \texttt{exampleCall}: An example call to the service as json encoded string
\end{itemize}

If a service accepts input arguments or outputs data, two additional parameters can be provided:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{input}
  \item \texttt{output}
\end{itemize}
